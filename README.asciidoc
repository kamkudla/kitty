= Kitty but with bold text in bright color

This repo is inspired by https://github.com/ckabalan/kitty/[ckabalan/kitty] and https://github.com/KittyPatch/kitty[KittyPatch/kitty]. 

The developer of Kitty has decided to not support bold text in bright colors, so the changes here are a patch that make it work. Discussions on the reasoning why has been extensive see https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/512[#512]. Compile from source and place `bold_is_bright yes` to `kitty.conf`.
